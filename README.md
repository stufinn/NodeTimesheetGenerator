# Node.js Timesheet Generator

Creates a set of MS Excel timesheets. Uses NodeJS and the [excel4node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/excel4node) module.

This project was started with the objective of automating an exceedingly boring, time consuming and error-prone task (i.e. creating timesheets for each month of the year).

To install and run this locally:

1. Fork & clone the repo to your local machine.
2. In the root folder of the repo run ```npm init``` in the terminal to install node dependencies.
3. Enter ```node app.js``` in the terminal to run the app. Optionally, ```nodemon app.js``` will allow the app to re-run each time a .js file is saved. To quit the nodemon process, hit ```control + c```.

FYI  - Beware that The app still needs work to clean up the code, and to allow for user inputs in order to determine the starting dates for the timesheets, number of months to create timesheets for etc.

***Contributions welcome!***
